# tu-cross-repository-linking

Owner: `tu-modeler`

## Purpose

Promote exact evidence-backed contract matches into cross-repository graph edges.

## Required guarantees

- Consume only schema-valid, snapshot-bound inputs.
- Preserve exact evidence provenance and epistemic classification.
- Produce deterministic, schema-valid artifacts.
- Never write to source repositories.
- Return explicit unknown, unresolved, stale, or conflict status instead of guessing.
