# tu-memory-verification

Owner: `tu-verifier`

## Purpose

Validate canonical records, references, digests, freshness, and rebuildable search indexes.

## Required guarantees

- Consume only schema-valid, snapshot-bound inputs.
- Preserve exact evidence provenance and epistemic classification.
- Produce deterministic, schema-valid artifacts.
- Never write to source repositories.
- Return explicit unknown, unresolved, stale, or conflict status instead of guessing.
